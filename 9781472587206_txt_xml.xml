<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000035">The year is 1616. William Shakespeare has just died and the world of the London theatres is mourning his loss. 1616 also saw the death of the famous Chinese playwright Tang Xianzu. Four hundred years on and Shakespeare is now an important meeting place for Anglo-Chinese cultural dialogue in the field of drama studies. In June 2014 (the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare’s birth), SOAS, The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust and the National Chung Cheng University of Taiwan gathered 20 scholars together to reflect on the theatrical practice of four hundred years ago and to ask: what does such an exploration mean culturally for us today? This ground-breaking study offers fresh insights into the respective theatrical worlds of Shakespeare and Tang Xianzu and asks how the brave new theatres of 1616 may have a vital role to play in the intercultural dialogue of our own time.</para>

Focusing on selected topics, scholars were paired and asked to reflect on each other’s paper, and revise their papers following an exciting meeting in London in June 2014. The result is a collection of essays that are not only original contributions to the study of English and Chinese theatre in themselves but also go a long way to highlight the differences <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000159" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0000144"/>

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000172">In focusing on a single year, this project has been inspired by similar approaches adopted by scholars such as Ray Huang in his <emphasis role="italic">1587: A Year of No Significance</emphasis> on Ming history and James Shapiro’s <emphasis role="italic">1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare</emphasis>. A number of theatrical and literary histories and biographies of playwrights have provided a useful framework for us to trace and take account of the events that took place in 1616. Unlike earlier studies which have tended to focus on a single country and culture, this book is keen to explore what we may learn by placing the theatrical worlds of the two countries and cultures side by side and by discussing one with an awareness of the other. Thomas Christensen’s recent work provides a panoramic survey of the global history of 1616, describing it as ‘a world of motion’. It is within this broader historical context that our book proposes to direct <?page value="2"?>its attention specifically at the theatrical worlds of China and England in 1616.</para>

      </indexterm>court, it appears that the histories of Chinese and English drama have given emphases to different theatrical forms. The height of English Renaissance drama is represented by popular drama in commercial theatres, whereas in China the focus of late Ming drama is usually on the form of ‘elite theatre’, written by scholarly playwrights for members of their literary circles and performed in their residences usually by private household troupes owned by themselves or their friends. It would be like the English playwrights and companies operating only to perform privately before their theatre patrons or at court.

These essays, then, challenge the homogeneous repercussions of the concept of the ‘global’ and instead focus on particularities and difference, the better to find complementary (and some overlapping) synergies.</para>

      </indexterm>Our structure demonstrates the ‘dialogic’ concept and design that we believe best serves this kind of discussion. In June 2014, at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, we gathered together pairs of scholars working on similar fields and periods, but in two different contexts and within different scholarly traditions. Each took as their point of departure one of ten theatre-related themes, made a presentation from within their own field of expertise and then engaged in open cross-cultural dialogue. Each section of this volume contains versions of the two essays – one from the Chinese theatre perspective and one from the English – revised in the light of the conversations and discussions that took place.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000198">As dialogues often begin with short exchanges, these essays are meant to speak to one another. For many of us who gathered, it was our first introduction to each other’s theatrical cultures by experts. We hope that the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the deaths of two of the greatest dramatists will mark the beginnings of future dialogues between our cultures and their respective fields of research.</para>

During the scene, Du Bao arrives to inspect the farms in Qingle county. The villagers were glad to have Prefect Du in office for three years, for he was kind and honest and promoted virtue and condemned corruption and evil practices. While he was in office, rules and regulations were established in all the villages, local organizations were set up, public granaries and village schools were organized: he was a true blessing for the villagers. Whilst on a tour to inspect the farms, all the villagers come to greet him in the official pavilion. Du Bao praises: ‘A pretty spot and well named Qingle, “Pure Joy”’. And then the villagers and official sing together:

        </indexterm>family, friends and neighbours. Among those mourning were his wife, Anne, originally from nearby Shottery. They had been married for almost thirty-four years (ever since William was only 18 and Anne 26). Their eldest child, Susanna (1583–1649), her physician husband, John Hall (c. 1575–1635), and their daughter, Elizabeth (1608–70), were no doubt in attendance, as was Shakespeare’s younger daughter, Judith (1585–1662) and her husband, Thomas Quiney (1589–?1662–3). Judith was two months pregnant with their first child whom they would proudly name Shakespeare Quiney. Funerals often call to mind earlier deaths. For his surviving family, Shakespeare’s evoked memories of Hamnet Shakespeare, the twin brother of Judith who had died some twenty years earlier, aged 11. Shakespeare’s sister, Joan Hart, would have been among the mourners, too. She was last surviving of his five siblings (three brothers and two sisters), the others having pre-deceased him by 1613. The vicar who presided over Shakespeare’s funeral was John Rogers, who, from 1611, was Shakespeare’s next-door neighbour, living in the old priest’s house close to the Guild Chapel. Shakespeare’s theatrical colleagues with whom he had worked for over thirty years in London were not able to be contacted in time to attend the funeral; Stratford-upon-Avon was a three- or four-day journey from London, and Shakespeare was buried two days after he died. But perhaps some of them were involved in the designing of the memorial bust for Shakespeare which was erected on the <?page value="21"?>north wall of the church at some point in the succeeding years. Importantly, this bust tells us that he died on 23 April, aged 53 (if this is understood to be the beginning of his fifty-third year, rather than a mistake, then Shakespeare died on his birthday; to support this is his christening on 26 April 1564 when he was likely to have been three days old).</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000479">The bust was made by a Dutch sculptor, Geerhart Janssen, who two years earlier had made the tomb and effigy for Shakespeare’s friend John Coombe (buried near the high altar in July 1614).

        </indexterm>Globe Theatre so the chances are that both father and son knew what Shakespeare looked like: high, rounded cheeks, small, sunken eyes, a high forehead and balding, auburn hair. We learn from the bust that Shakespeare was right-handed; he holds some paper in his left hand, while the other (usually furnished by the church with a local goose feather for his quill) is poised to compose. It looks as if he is wearing the scarlet livery tunic of the King’s Men theatre company, harking back to the coronation of 1603. That had been among the greatest occasions in Shakespeare’s life, certainly one of the most prestigious. He and some of his fellow actors and company shareholders were invited to help form part of the royal procession through London. We do not know precisely when the monument was installed but it seems to be a tribute to his memory by friends, colleagues and townspeople. Stratford-upon-Avon historian Mairi Macdonald points out that Thomas Wilson, a vicar with Puritan leanings, took over the running of the church in 1619 and that this colourful memorial is unlikely to have been to his taste.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000481" role="end-ch-note" label="1">

Shakespeare will live on in his works long after the bust in Holy Trinity Church has vanished (the bust was restored in 2013 and is seen by the hundreds of thousands of people a year who visit Shakespeare’s grave). At the top of the memorial can be seen Shakespeare’s coat of arms, the official sign that he was a ‘gentleman’. This was a significant achievement for the <indexterm class="startofrange" xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000505">

          <primary>Shakespeare, John</primary>
        </indexterm>John Shakespeare (before 1530–1601) was born into a farming family from the nearby village of Snitterfield. He was a tradesman all his life (a maker of gloves and a trader of white leather) but achieved public prominence and distinction through several civic offices he held in Stratford-upon-Avon, including bailiff (the equivalent of a mayor). During his year in office (1568–9), he authorized two professional playing companies to perform in Stratford-upon-Avon: the Queen’s Men, and the Earl of Worcester’s Men. These occasions could have constituted his young son’s first theatrical experiences, and marked the first time the town had formally welcomed visiting troupes. Shakespeare was granted the title and social status of ‘gentleman’ for his father by the College of Heralds in 1596 by being able to claim ancestral service to King Henry VII (1485–1509), and the motto ‘Non sanz Droict’, which means ‘Not without Right’. This sounds defensive, perhaps because twenty years earlier an application by John Shakespeare himself for a coat of arms had not come to fruition. As the eldest son, Shakespeare had inherited and was able to use the title and the coat of arms for himself. One likes to think that it was displayed in his family home, <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000507" class="singular">

In 1598, for example, the scholar and clergyman Francis Meres had referred to the ‘mellifluous and honey-tongued Shakespeare’ and to his ‘sugared sonnets’; in the same year, a fellow poet, Richard Barnfield, wrote about Shakespeare’s ‘honey-flowing vein’ in his <emphasis role="italic">Poems in Divers Humours</emphasis>; echoing Meres, historian and poet John Weever referred to Shakespeare as ‘honey-tongued’ the following year in his <emphasis role="italic">Epigrams in the Oldest Cut and Newest Fashion</emphasis>. The mention of the Roman poet Virgil pays tribute to the significant use that Shakespeare made of Latin source material (especially for three of his four Roman plays); and the way he uses Italy (in whole or in part) as a location for seven of his other thirty-eight plays, and one of his two narrative poems (<indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000524" class="singular">

Virgil, of course, was influential in shaping an Italian national identity, a role that would be echoed by Shakespeare’s place in a rapidly expanding British imperial culture in the eighteenth century.

It was one of the king’s many grammar schools that established Protestant thinking and religious reform in the state’s developing educational system. The Tudor grammar schools were part of the government’s machinery to ensure that (as one royal proclamation put it) ‘good literature and discipline might be diffused and propagated throughout all parts of our Kingdom, as wherein the best government and administration of affairs consists’.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000529" role="end-ch-note" label="4">

Its records for that period, like many others in England, do not survive, but we know about the educational curriculum and practice of the time. The boys were taught Latin rigorously six days a week through the whole year, going to school from 6.00 am in summer and from 7.00 am in winter. They stayed until dusk and had half days on Thursdays and Saturdays. The major Christian festivals provided the few annual holidays.</para>

His humanist schooling in the crafts of language and classical literature is writ large across the whole body of his work.

The theatres were closed during Lent which would have given him plenty of time (six weeks) to spend at his Stratford-upon-Avon home with his family, to read and write in relative peace and quiet. Between 2010 and 2015 the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust commissioned an archaeological dig of the site (New Place was demolished in 1759) which confirmed it to be a grand manor house to be enjoyed by someone of considerable means. Traces of the family’s inner dwelling on the far side of the courtyard were discovered along with many artefacts from Shakespeare’s period, including evidence of feasting and cottage industries. <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000570" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0000551"/>

With a home like New Place, Shakespeare seems to have lived the life of a commuter, someone who lodged in London and thrived there professionally, but whose grandest, most prized address was in Stratford-upon-Avon. He divided his time between two quite different worlds and locales, the personal and the professional.</para>

You could stand in the yard and watch a play for a penny or you could pay a few more pence and have a cushion, or sit in one of the galleries. Sixpence bought you a place in the Lords’ Room (where you could be seen by the audience, even though your view of the actors was poor). The audience capacity in the new theatre was around three thousand and, as the company’s leading dramatist, the more successful Shakespeare’s plays became the more money he would make. But income fluctuated year on year and takings were always contingent on outbreaks of the plague (when the theatres had to close and the companies often went on tour instead). In a lucrative year, it is estimated Shakespeare earned around £200 from his company shares and Globe receipts.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000576" role="end-ch-note" label="5">

His son, William, determined to rescue his family name and to ensure that he would never know the same fate, became keenly ambitious and hugely successful. An alternative view, first proposed by David Fallow of the University of Exeter, is that John Shakespeare continued to make significant sums of money through his wool dealing and that he sold some of his real estate not because he was encountering financial difficulty, but in order to re-invest the capital in wool. In 1576, as part of that earlier attempt to acquire a coat of arms for himself, John Shakespeare is said to be in possession of £500. Fallow suggests that Shakespeare himself first went to London in order to represent his father in the wool-dealing business (known as ‘brogging’). This revisionist view of John Shakespeare’s financial situation would explain how and why, after the death of his father in 1601, the size of Shakespeare’s investments increased considerably. So, it may be that Shakespeare’s money came from three major sources: a gift from the Earl of Southampton which positioned him socially and professionally, the investments he was able to make in the theatre company and theatres, and the estate he inherited from his father (including, of course, the family’s business-home on Henley Street).</para>

        </footnote> Had Shakespeare died in London, he would almost certainly have been buried in Westminster Abbey. Basse’s poem is important because in it he casts Shakespeare into a distinctly English rather than classical literary tradition. He imagines other poets having to move up in order for Shakespeare to be accommodated alongside them in the bed of the grave:

There is also a group of plays, which first appeared in the second issue of the 1664 Third Folio, in which there may be reasons to think that Shakespeare had some kind of helping hand.</para>

When the scene opens, Yu has barely escaped dying of lovesickness, for a blank letter from Suhui has reached him by mistake and he therefore suspects that she wants to break up with him. It is a moonlit night. He feels weak and lonesome and hopes to dream of her. The stage direction then reads, ‘He falls asleep. The <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0000853" class="singular">

Mu’s mother enters but, to his surprise, refuses his request to meet with Mu, saying Mu does not know him and is entertaining a guest. She asks him to leave, closes the door and exits. When Yu knocks at the door again, Mu’s maid enters. She repeats that Mu does not know him. He begins to feel angry and insists on seeing her. Ignoring the account Yu gives of suffering for Mu’s sake, the maid asks him to leave or wait till her guest departs. She then shuts the door. Yu is left, anxious. He then notices that the music has stopped and the door is open. So he hides in the <?page value="42"?>shade of the tree and waits.

In <emphasis role="italic">Peony Pavilion</emphasis>, also named <emphasis role="italic">The Soul’s Return</emphasis> (<emphasis role="italic">Huanhun ji</emphasis> 還魂記), death can be regarded as a willed protest and a necessary means by which the heroine is empowered to pursue love in a spiritual form without sociocultural constraints, hence the ‘Spirit Roaming’. In <emphasis role="italic">West Loft</emphasis> the significance of death has little to do with insistence on individual subjectivity.

Although the author’s objective is to sanction marriage between a scholar and a courtesan, his disposal of a concubine, another socially inferior member, reveals his inevitable patriarchal mindset. Contrary to Tang’s yellow-robed knight-errant, who aids the helpless heroine to be reunited with her husband, the knight-errant Xu in Yuan’s play focuses on fulfilling the hero’s wish. The male-centred perspective can be further evidenced by Xu’s rather unnecessary testing of Mu’s love and fidelity. After Xu rescues her, he pretends to ask her to be his concubine in order to test whether her feelings for Yu are genuine. The implication is that Xu thinks Mu less trustworthy and sincere because of her inferior social class as a courtesan. A play that appears to be about true love regardless of class difference may in fact be ridden with subconscious contradictions.</para>

While playgoers would have entered the playhouse with different expectations, the power of a good story had the capacity to bring an audience together through the simple pleasure of watching it unfold. While many plays of the period speak to the particular interests of their original audiences, there are those that share a timeless resonance.

This fact poses certain difficulties when trying to determine the blockbusters and popular stories of 1616; a play that proved popular in one theatre would not necessarily receive the same response from a markedly different group of spectators in another venue. Although writing styles altered over time, holding the mirror up to reflect an ever-changing London and worlds elsewhere, certain narratives and plot devices evidently held a perennial appeal for dramatists – and presumably audiences – alike. While new plays were being written year upon year, some old plays also continued to hold the stage and evidently proved popular with spectators. <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001038" class="singular">

The blockbuster’s sudden notoriety can prove a reason in itself for people to see it, though the sudden rush of interest does not mean that it will prove popular with audiences in years to come. Popular stories endure because of the individual elements they contain. The craftsmanship that goes into combining elements of popular stories is something that can be studied, emulated and refashioned. The success of a blockbuster on the other hand can owe more to chance than cultivation.

Having approved his daughter’s marriage to the man he was ready to sentence to death earlier in the drama, the King brings the proceedings to a close with the prospect of a celebratory feast. During the course of the drama the lover Mucedorus dons two disguises, kills a bear, evades an attempt upon his own life and reveals himself to be the Prince of Valeria, rather than a lowly shepherd as he had led people to believe.

Like their English counterparts – Mucedorus and Amadine, Othello and Desdemona, Leontes and Hermione – Yu Shuye and Mu Suhui discover that the course of true love never did run smooth. As with <emphasis role="italic">Mucedorus, The Tale of the West Loft</emphasis> concludes with Yu’s father giving his consent for the marriage, and the play ends with a grand wedding scene. It can be assumed that spectators would have felt moved by the sense of harmony that is engendered at the close of both plays. It would seem that both English and Chinese audiences in the period took pleasure in the triumph of love in spite of attempts to thwart it.</para>

What sprung to theatregoers’ minds in the April of 1616 when news arrived in London of William Shakespeare’s death? Would Londoners have associated him immediately with the staging of a cannibalistic banquet, an exit pursued by a bear, the blinding of an old man and the baptism of the infant Princess Elizabeth? Or would their first thoughts have been of a dramatist whose star had waned, whose plays seemed outdated when compared to the freshly minted dramas of 1616?</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001132">As Ben Jonson’s tribute to his friend and rival in the First Folio of 1623 attests, Shakespeare’s name came to represent the ‘applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!’ But by 1616 some aspects of Shakespeare’s dramatic technique and chosen subject matter would have differed markedly to the writing styles of some of his contemporaries.

The depiction of Yan Shifan, though, seems quite faithful to historical reality: he was arrogant, self-indulgent, debauched and engaged in the corrupt practice of selling official positions. He manipulated Yan Song during his father’s later years in court.

It turns out that this pitiable woman, who originally came from a good family in Yangzhou, was wrested from her home against her will by Yan Shifan. Her father was killed and her family was stripped of its property. Moreover, when she lost the master’s favour because of the fading away of her beauty, she was blinded by Yan Shifan’s wife and was pitilessly expelled from Yan’s house. As a result the blind woman could only sing and beg for a living in the street. In the same scene, Guo, Zou and Lin also meet a male beggar called Hu Yi who is a fellow townsman of Yan Song. While Yan Song was frequently given financial help by Hu’s family before he gained fame and fortune, after he rose to power and position, he allowed his housekeeper to take Hu’s property illegally. Though Hu Yi went to the capital and took half a year to file a lawsuit against Yan Song, he had no success and tragically ended up as a beggar.

        </footnote> Yang Jisheng stays up late at night in his study drafting a memorial against Yan Song. By means of this memorial, he aims ‘to eliminate the court and the provinces of all evil-doers’. Yang Jisheng knows that, not being a censorial official, he will put himself in danger by trying to impeach Yan Song. In submitting his memorials against Yan Song, he will contravene the established censorial procedure and be punished. He is, however, acting out the relationship of ruler and minister by a public gesture of loyalty to the emperor in order to maintain the legitimacy of his position within the imperial system. Yang feels strongly that it is his moral obligation to protest, and his strong commitment to the emperor leads him to disregard his own interests in order to save the country. It is improbable that Yang anticipates that his actions will result in the fall of Yan Song; rather, it is a matter of demonstrating his own integrity in the face of the political circumstances. The unexpected cry of a ghost reminds Yang that he is morally responsible not only to the emperor but crucially also to his family and his ancestors. As the personification of Yang’s own sense of morality and integrity, the ghost disapproves of him sacrificing himself for the state and urges him to reassess his duties towards his parents and ancestors. Confronted by the contradictory demands of loyalty and filial piety, Yang cannot find a way of reconciling the two and finally chooses the demands of loyalty rather than those of filial piety. However, to heighten the drama of Yang’s moral dilemma <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001292" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0001274"/>
        <?page value="73"?>between filial piety and loyalty, the playwright brings Yang’s wife Madame Zhang into the scene who engages in a lively debate with Yang. While Madame Zhang is sympathetic to her husband’s resentment of the current political chaos, she tries to dissuade him from indicting Yan Song. Regarding filial piety as a higher value than loyalty to one’s ruler, Madame Zhang advises her husband that one is obliged to preserve one’s life for the sake of one’s family. Yang Jisheng, on the contrary, maintains determinedly that filial piety has to be given up in favour of loyalty to the emperor. Thus the moral dilemma in which Yang Jisheng finds himself is laid bare. In this way, <indexterm class="startofrange" xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001293">

The play turns into something more like a citizen play about the London boy who makes good; and his final downfall is ascribed to the envy and false testimony against him of various jealous lords, in league with Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, who is the play’s chief villain.

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001354">Given the attitude of governmental suspicion, or of outright suppression, it is not surprising that so little Tudor history was dramatized under Elizabeth, especially as the most dramatically interesting material was the most risky. Principal among such topics was the descent of the crown. Too much of what had happened since the Tudor appropriation of the throne – including that appropriation itself, since Henry VII’s accession marked the biggest rupture in the lineal descent of the crown since the Norman Conquest of 1066 – was still dangerous. No one bothered to dramatize the uncontested descent of the crown from Tudor father to son; but the contested inheritances, of Mary and of Elizabeth, were much more interesting, and so too – though it was left until the very last – were the challenges to Henry VII himself. The messy end of Henry VIII’s first two marriages had the potential to call into question Elizabeth’s own legitimacy. Her own refusal to name an heir had further ruled out the descent of the crown as a topic throughout her lifetime, as any discussion of it was fiercely suppressed. Those problematic Tudor successions were rendered safe for dramatization at last only by the accession of the Stuart, James VI of Scotland, as <indexterm class="startofrange" xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001355">

The final event of the play, however, is the visit of the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, to England: he actually made the visit in 1520, to see his aunt Catherine of Aragon, but the play relocates it to the time of Henry’s wife of the 1540s, the Protestant Katherine Parr, and the whole historical sequence is recast to show Catholic wickedness, in the form of Wolsey, opposed to Katherine Parr’s virtuous Protestantism. The play is given a contemporary spin by the positive presentation of Charles, whose territories included Spain. The warmth might seem surprising; but 1604 was also the year of the Treaty of London that at last, after many decades of hostility, established peace with Spain. Tudor foreign policy, in fact, is inflected to mirror that of the Stuarts.</para>

It covers the death of Edward VI, Wyatt’s support of the lineal heir Mary against the attempt to put Jane Grey on the throne and then his rebellion against her over her marriage to Philip of Spain. It thus manages both to support the principle of linear succession – Mary as rightful queen – while opposing her Catholicism: a joint emphasis that made it eminently suitable for playing after the transfer of the crown to the Protestant James.</para>

This play too, however, contains a surprising element, in that Philip of Spain, like Rowley’s Charles V, is presented favourably: it is he who, in opposition to the ecclesiastics Stephen Gardiner and Cardinal Pole, insists that Mary be reconciled to her sister, and who speaks warmly in her praise. Again, James’s new treaty with Spain seems likely to have influenced his portrayal. 1604 was also, however, the year that saw the start of work on the new Authorized Version of the Bible, an event that is foreshadowed at the very end of the play when Elizabeth, acceding to the throne after Mary’s death, declares that she will make the English Bible ‘the Iewell that we still loue best’ (line 1582), universally available to all her subjects, ‘that happy yssue that shall vs succeed’ (line 1595): a phrase that seems to enfold both the Bible and James himself.

Warbeck was recognized as Prince Richard by various European sovereigns including James IV of Scotland, who gave him a close kinswoman as his bride.

        </footnote> That seems to have given Ford his cue, and perhaps also his subtitle of ‘A Strange Truth’. His Warbeck is more kingly than the King, and always insists on his royal identity. The very first scene shows <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001455" class="singular">

        </indexterm>Henry stressing his own lineal right to the crown, but it is striking that he is the only person who does so. He is not presented as a villain, but his less attractive qualities, including his keenness to extract money from his subjects, open the way for Warbeck to capture the audience’s sympathies. He by contrast is always shown in honourable mode, not least in his role as husband. His wife is presented as loyal and loving, and her belief in her husband never wavers. His downfall is ascribed to fate or destiny, not to Providence or God; the play indeed rigorously avoids declaring for or against Warbeck’s claims. It is the play that potentially most strongly threatens the house of Tudor, but the Tudors were by this time very safely in the past.</para>

He justifies it on the grounds that its sources are pure English, and that its twin bases are ‘Truth and State’ (line 26). He follows his sources more closely than most of the other dramatists of Tudor history, with none of the chronological upsets of the earlier plays; but he avoids making any decision as to where ‘truth’ might lie.

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001922">As its short title <emphasis role="italic">The Most Distant Relative Goes Overboard</emphasis> suggests, this play centres on a climactic moment in Act Three when Duke Zhao of Chu, during his flight from the capital after defeat by Wu Zixu’s army, has to make the difficult decision about whom to sacrifice because his boat can no longer carry all the people on board. In the end, Duke Zhao’s wife and son throw themselves into the river as we are told Duke Zhao considered them as more ‘distant relatives’ than his brother whom he chooses to save.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001923">There are several major differences between the Yuan dynasty commercial print version and the Ming palace edition. First, the Ming palace edition clearly tones down the element of Wu Zixu’s revenge against his former lord found in the Yuan version, which understandably might not sit well with the imperial audience at <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001924" class="singular">

        </indexterm>court. In Act One of the Ming palace edition, the dispute between the states of Wu and Chu is instead accounted for by Duke Zhao’s refusal to return a precious sword to the prince of the Wu state.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001925" role="end-ch-note" label="19">

        </footnote> Second, the Ming palace version also adds an element of divine intervention which changes the nature and tone of the play. The Duke’s wife and son who are sacrificed in the play are later saved by the Dragon God guarding the river, hence leading to a happy reunion meeting at the end of the play. Third, whereas <?page value="102"?>the title of the play appears as ‘King Zhao of Chu’ in the Yuan dynasty edition, it was changed to ‘Duke Zhao of Chu’ in the Ming edition, stressing that Chu was only a tributary state of Zhou, as the play underlines the power and authority of the King of Zhou. Moreover, the play concludes with a fourteen-line verse serving as an encomium to the King of Zhou and most probably directed towards the Ming emperor watching the play, which is a common feature in Ming court plays.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001927" role="end-ch-note" label="20">

        <?page value="103"?>it is arguably through these dramatic texts that we see the fuller impact of the Ming court on the history of Chinese theatre. As inspection copies, palace editions of drama might be regarded as products of state censorship. Yet it was precisely because of this need for court inspection that the textual recording of dramas was initiated. They would otherwise have been lost. In fact, many of the texts preserved in the sixty plays from the Ming palace are the earliest editions we have of these dramas. Only four of them, including Play No. 58 discussed here, have earlier so-called ‘Yuan dynasty editions’ from the fourteenth century.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001938" role="end-ch-note" label="22">

In the companion piece to this essay Tian Yuan Tan demonstrates that Ming court <indexterm class="startofrange" xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001991">

        </indexterm>theatre production was crucial to the historical development of Chinese theatre. By 1616 in England, theatre was established as a regular component of court entertainment, but plays were not written primarily or exclusively for court performance, nor – unlike in Ming China – can we identify a corpus of ‘court plays’. At religious and secular feasts <?page value="109"?>– Christmas, Shrovetide, All Hallows on 1 November – and at dynastic and state occasions the Tudor and Jacobean court was entertained by revels, including not only plays but also moral interludes, maskings, tilts and, increasingly during Shakespeare’s career, plays. Bacon’s observation might seem disingenuous or drily ironic. Spectacles and drama of different kinds were more than mere ‘toys’. Interludes, plays and masques could be both political and personal, often obliquely counselling the monarch or serving as propaganda for factional or dynastic interests. Tian Yuan Tan argues that, in the same period in China, the court approved and promoted plays which were, broadly speaking, morality plays, and that the differences between the <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0001992" class="singular">

Similarly, plays performed at court during Shakespeare’s working life were subject to some censorship, aesthetic as well as ideological. For playwrights, close to the court and mindful of producing plays to be performed before the king, we can assume a degree of circumspection or inner censorship. In this essay I will explore the dynamics between theatre practice, court performance and state censorship, focusing on specific cases, as, unlike Ming court theatre, the influence of the court’s Office of the Revels extended beyond court drama to popular theatre.</para>

        </footnote> The evolution of the role of the Master of the Revels during Shakespeare’s working life to encompass not only the material production of court entertainment but the licensing and censorship of all plays prior to performance is indicative of how seriously the Elizabethan and Jacobean state took its pastimes.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002064">Tilney’s commission stipulated that players should recite their plays before the Master, a practice which must soon have proved impractical and which no doubt must on some occasions have been replaced by reading the play manuscript (the so-called ‘book’). Play manuscripts which were perused and marked by the Master of the Revels offer irrefutable evidence of state censorship. In reconstructing theatrical censorship during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, we are fortunate that a number of play manuscripts have survived which show the interventions, objections and occasional rewritings of the <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002065" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0002015"/>

        <?page value="113"?>Master of the Revels. One of the most well-known cases is that of Tilney’s censorship of the manuscript of an unpublished play about the humanist scholar and statesman, Thomas More. The play telescopes two disparate narratives: the May Day riots of 1517 against foreigners <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002067" class="singular">
          <primary>London</primary>

        </indexterm>in London which Thomas More helped to quell, and the Reformation politics of Henry VIII’s break with Rome leading to More’s execution in 1534. Both these narratives are politically provocative in so far as they represent alleged acts of treason. The insurgents are seen as traitors because their uprising is directed against foreigners who came from countries friendly to the king (they are referred to as ‘Frenchmen’ and ‘strangers’, but in the manuscript Tilney changes the reference to ‘Lombards’). The other act which may have been regarded as treasonous and therefore not to be represented on stage is contained in a scene in which More denies the King’s supremacy in matters spiritual and resigns his office. Tilney has marked the scene for omission and has written the marginal note ‘All Alter’.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002068">Throughout the manuscript Tilney consistently registers his objection to representing and referring to riots against foreigners who had taken refuge in London and who were blamed by many for causing economic disadvantage to the indigenous population. The entire first scene of the play in which rowdy citizens protest against the rights and privileges of the ‘strangers’ in the city has been marked for omission, indicated in the margins by rules and crosses.

Tilney’s directive indicates a shift in emphasis from the actual rebellion and its causes to the suppressing of it. There is more <?page value="114"?>piecemeal censorship later – two of the nobles, for example, comment on the restiveness of the Commons, using words such as ‘dangerous times’, ‘frowning vulgar brow’, ‘distracted countenance of grief’, ‘displeased commons of the city’. Tilney has written in the margin ‘Mend this’. Censors are not of course interested in what constitutes a good play and this is very much in evidence in Tilney’s imperatives – entire scenes are to be omitted and replaced simply by reports of the events they represent. It is evident that Tilney intended the play to be revised and rewritten, not suppressed altogether, and indeed parts of the play were revised and the revisions form part of the manuscript as we have it. Yet there is no evidence that the play was ever acted and there is no printed text. It may be that his interference was so extensive that the play was not viable for performance.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002452">The implications of this polarization of Shakespeare and Jonson are massive. On the one hand, Shakespeare’s involvement in the living business of theatre and his indifference to the ossified record of print can be understood as one source of his greatness, an adjunct to the ‘Negative Capability’ that Keats ascribed to him. Just as Shakespeare was able to write in the midst of ‘uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason’, so he was capable of giving himself up fully to the collaborative business of theatre, while Jonson remained aloof.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002453" role="end-ch-note" label="4">

        </footnote> On the other hand, the Jonson/Shakespeare dyad licenses the familiar view that Shakespeare wanted to be performed and forgotten about, that ‘he never meant to be studied’. As if you could never study something that didn’t positively intend you to study it – which would rule out most academic work, especially in the sciences.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002467">Recently, however, this vision of Shakespeare and of the broader relationship between theatre and print in early modern England has been challenged from several directions. This has happened mainly via a debate over the earliest, small-format editions of Shakespeare’s plays, the quartos. Over the course of the twentieth century, scholars turned to the quartos mostly for the purpose of establishing an authoritative text. By comparing different quarto texts, where they existed, with texts in the Folio, and by analysing the habits of particular publishers, printers and typesetters, bibliographers hoped that they could <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002468" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0002434"/>

        </footnote> Surviving copies have been intensively scrutinized in terms of their size, their paper, their typography and mise-en-page and the ways in which they were annotated by readers, while renewed attention has been paid to the careers of the printers who brought these texts into being. At stake in the discussion is our sense of the location of the literary in early modern England, which is significantly also a discussion about the place of literary studies in the interdisciplinary maelstrom.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002477">This is clear from the intervention that kick-started the current debate, an article by the bibliographer Peter Blayney on ‘The Publication of Playbooks’. Blayney argued that, contrary to the assumptions of many literary scholars, playbooks formed only a very minor part of the output of the <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002478" class="singular">
          <primary>London</primary>
        </indexterm>London presses, and they were often not a profitable line for those who published them. In order to establish this, Blayney did a lot of counting, thanks to which he demonstrated that in the average year in the period extending from 1582 to the closing of the theatres in 1642, only about six new plays appeared, out of perhaps 460 titles. Furthermore, the most popular playbooks received only eight or nine reprints in twenty-five years, whereas the most popular devotional books received between ten and thirty-six reprints.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002479" role="end-ch-note" label="6">

In quarto format plays typically occupy only about ten sheets of paper, with each sheet folded in four and cut to make the book. Like most early modern books, they would have been sold unbound, though their sheets might have been crudely sewn together to facilitate reading. Their physical insubstantiality means that ‘playbooks’ may not even count as books. Instead, Stallybrass and Chartier suggest, we should think of them as pamphlets, ephemeral publications that would have been read avidly and then discarded.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002511" role="end-ch-note" label="10">

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002520">The narratives advanced thus far might be said to suit a historicist temperament. They put drama in its place, reminding us that it was a small part of the early modern social world. And such a move may be salutary; just as new historicist critics have claimed that the marginality of drama – its place in the liberties and at the edges of the early modern city – gave it its power to critique society, so we might value the playbook precisely for its precarious position in the marketplace.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002521" role="end-ch-note" label="12">

This he demonstrates partly through a proliferation of graphs and tables, which extend and to some extent challenge the statistical work initiated by Blayney. But Erne also undertakes a good deal of cultural bibliography, looking at Shakespeare’s presence in the marketplace in terms of the number of plays that were mistakenly attributed to him, considering who published Shakespeare and why, and exploring the question of who <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002543" class="singular">

        </footnote> All of this activity might seem quite ‘literary’, and it certainly appears that playgoing and playreading counted as fashionable activities in Dering’s social circle. But it is likely that Dering’s main aim was not closeted reading but household performance; he frequently bought multiple playbooks, sometimes specifying that these were multiples of a single title (‘3 playebookes of ye Woman-Hater’, ‘6 playbookes of Band Ruff and Cuff’) and he invested in wigs and false beards for the actors.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002667" role="end-ch-note" label="35">

        </footnote> But although one analysis estimates that just under half of Wolfreston’s library was made up of ‘English Literature’, in practice a good part of this ‘literature’ is made up of pamphlets that might have come fresh from the pedlar’s pack. These include such works as <emphasis role="italic">Good Counsell to be Hadd at a Cheap Rate</emphasis> (1663), the sixteen pages of which urge their readers to forbear cursing and swearing and to make patience their constant companion. Wolfreston also bought several works by John Taylor, the Water-Poet, and jest-books such as <emphasis role="italic">Mirth in Abundance</emphasis> (1659), <emphasis role="italic">The Pleasant Conceits of Old Hobson, the Merry Londoner</emphasis> (1640?) and Robert Armin’s <emphasis role="italic">Foole upon Foole</emphasis> (1605). Far from allowing us to speak of the elevation of playbooks to ‘classic’ status, therefore, Wolfreston’s collection suggests that they may have continued to be perceived as part of a capacious popular culture.</para>

          </indexterm>late Ming was a period when drama emancipated itself from the confines of court performance and communal rites and came within the purview of highly literate individuals, who, when faced with the varied traditions of drama and the new dilemmas of self-fashioning, ushered in a second boom for literary drama in the history of Chinese literature. The process was uneven and fraught with risks large and small as the breakdown of sumptuary practice, the ready access to print and the diversification of literary standards converged to produce new opportunities and new dangers for literary authorship. Situated in a unique force field riven with particular audiences, aesthetic demands and social tensions inherent in the genre, the authorship of drama became a contested site fraught with new possibilities for authorship and the corollary literati identity formation. By the end of the seventeenth century, the social energy that powered the formation of the late Ming/early Qing corpus found new <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002927" class="singular">

The intermittent efflorescence of dramatic authorship that culminated in the publication of key texts of both the southern and northern drama traditions in the 1610s disabuses us of any notion of historic inevitability and instead invites us to consider what institutional factors conspired to make drama an attractive field of endeavour for literary authors during this period.<indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0002931" class="singular">

The terms of collaboration do not develop unilaterally, and in some cases seem to move counter to the broader historical sweep. In fact, dramatic authorship in 1616 illustrates a much wider and more diverse range of definitions of collaboration that blur, rather than reinforce, the distinctions between collaborators, authors and ‘co-authors’.</para>

          </indexterm>folio, which appeared in November 1616, seems to consolidate rather than create practices of attribution in which assertions of single authorship override the fine details of collaboration. Second, the authorial attributions are decidedly scattered. Four are attributed explicitly to known authors, although one – ‘Ch. Marklin’ – appears in an unfamiliar form and may well cause confusion. Two more title pages employ initials to stand for the author, with one set of initials (those on <emphasis role="italic">Chrysanaleia</emphasis>) pieced out by the civic rather than personal identity of the author, credited as ‘Citizen and Draper of LONDON’. The dedication inside the book identifies the author more explicitly as ‘An. Mundy’, just as the dedication to <emphasis role="italic">Cupid’s Whirligig</emphasis> adds the initials ‘E.S.’ to a volume with no attribution on its title page. The other title pages make no mention of authors, but two of the plays are explicitly revised: <emphasis role="italic">Mucedorus</emphasis> is ‘amplified with new additions’ and <emphasis role="italic">Jack Drum’s Entertainment</emphasis> is ‘newly corrected’. The four dramas with no information on their title pages include a civil entertainment, two plays for a children’s company and one for an Elizabethan adult company, but the authors are not credited.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003061">These publications collectively demonstrate the unpredictability of print representations of early modern dramatic authorship. Collaborative plays are represented as sole authored; sole-authored plays are represented as anonymous; authors themselves are renamed or misnamed. The inconsistency and inaccuracy of authorial attributions on dramatic title pages tend to be treated as a lack, as in Michel Foucault’s identification of the impulse to ‘locate the space left empty by the author’s disappearance’.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003062" role="end-ch-note" label="6">

          </footnote> Certainly this is the aim of attribution studies that seek to identify authors and categorize plays into authorial canons, and this is an aim aligning neatly with the strategies of Shakespeare and Jonson’s contemporaries in Ming China, who ‘explicitly acknowledged that they harboured “intent”’.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003071" role="end-ch-note" label="7">

For this, I am inclined to stress Mark Robson’s utilization of a model of ‘signature’ and ‘countersignature’, in which ‘an anonymous text might … be thought of as the “without-signature,” in which the unsigned is figured in terms of an attitude towards the unknown that retains the possibility of an ethical relation’.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003077" role="end-ch-note" label="8">

Tracy Hill discusses the significance of Munday’s reworking of patriarchal models of authorship (traditionally, the idea of ‘begetting’ or ‘fathering’ a text) through his deferral to London, referred to elsewhere as ‘tender mother and Nurse’. In <emphasis role="italic">Chrysanaleia</emphasis>, Munday figures his own masculine authorship as birthed by another institution conceived of as female, the Fishmongers’ Company, and speaks of himself as an orphan. Hill argues:

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003095">The Fishmongers’ Company perform in a metonymic fashion the maternal role that London more generally often does for Munday. In contrast to the usual representation of the City ‘Fathers’, the Fishmongers are presented as a mother figure in relation to those who seek employment with them, who Munday … likens to ‘Rivers’ directing themselves naturally towards ‘their nursing Mother the Sea’. The master, warden and assistants of the Fishmongers, he claims here, had been entirely responsible for his birth and upbringing and even in adulthood he still places himself as dependent on their collective ability to nurture him.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003096" role="end-ch-note" label="9">

The act of authorizing the text here brings into play both ‘countersign’ (the partial accreditation of the name ‘A.M.’ that draws attention to what is lacking) and ‘sign’ by bringing into the authorial partnership a series of social and civic <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003102" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0003057"/>
          <?page value="170"?>institutions to which Munday considers himself beholden. The performance of authorship in this particular instance is enabled by Munday’s subordination of his own name. Print authorization signifies much more than a simple attribution (or lack of the same). It mediates modes of authorial representation that situate the text to a greater or lesser extent within the social circumstances that gave occasion to it. I suggest that what is happening in this year – and by extension, the period – is less an emergence of the modern authorizing author than a complex mediation of the potential agencies of authorization that shape texts. The trope of the begetting father figure becomes unsustainable because of the complexity of authorial relationships.</para>

Marklin is a fascinating figure, who in print takes sole responsibility for the entire, newly extended play of <emphasis role="italic">Doctor Faustus</emphasis>, with no reference made to previous versions or distinctions within the text. The 1619 quarto ‘corrects’ the authorial attribution to ‘Ch. Mar’ and adds notice of the new additions. Whether the ‘Mar’ of 1619 refers to ‘Marklin’ or ‘Marlowe’ is perhaps irrelevant, as variant spellings of names in the period are common. But both quartos present information that jars with modern understandings of authorship. ‘Marklin’ certainly did not write the whole of the play, and the additions announced as ‘new’ by the 1619 quarto are in fact at least <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003112" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0003088"/>

          </footnote> At stake here are a set of fundamental questions about the stake authors had in their own dramatic authorship. Did collaborating authors expect or anticipate credit for specific contributions, beyond payment? Did an author retain a sense of proprietary right over the words they had contributed, or did the unity of the play take precedence? Would authors want to be individually identified within a play, and is this an appropriate critical question to be asking?

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003166">The important distinction I would like to make here is between the acknowledgement of ‘Middleton’ and ‘Rowley’ as separate and identifiable identities within the work, and ‘Middleton-and-Rowley’ as a combined entity. In the case of <emphasis role="italic">A Fair Quarrel</emphasis>, Nicol argues for the importance of understanding a creative conflict within the play that aligns with authorial identities. While this conflict may not have appeared so explicit to early audiences, Nicol argues that the retention of both Middleton’s customary satire and Rowley’s flare for romance enables a creative conflict that, if we were to assume title-page authorizations carry particular meaning, justifies the inclusion of both names on the 1617 title page. Here, the names are bound in parentheses in a way that simultaneously separates and yokes together the two authors in support of the whole. This may be coincidence, but a relatively rare acknowledgement of collaboration on a title page fits in this instance with a play that Nicol argues is dependent on the juxtaposition of two distinct voices and ideologies.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003167">The wider importance of Nicol’s work for this period, however, is that it argues for an attuned and individual response to instances of collaboration, which in other cases might prioritize the authorial influence of actors, <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003168" class="singular">

          </footnote> Nor does it deny the importance of establishing co-authors and individual style, as long as this does not happen at the cost of examination of specific authorial strategy. In this period, a consensus seems to be emerging that authors can neither be disappeared entirely into a text nor considered as autonomous of the circumstances within which they write. Reading title pages attentively may reveal much more about the text’s self-conception than is usually noted, and we need to accord them this kind of nuanced attention.</para>

At the beginning of Jonson’s monumental book, his authorship and authority are simultaneously inscribed through the identification of a single name, presented here in block capitals. Yet within this poem there is another quill working from the first line: ‘May I subscribe a name? Dares my bold quill / Write that or good or ill’. The poem begins, conventionally, with Heyward musing on his own authorship before his own identity is subordinated to the volume’s praise of Jonson. As with all commendatory poems, this serves a double purpose of praising the poem’s addressee while also foregrounding the talent of the author. At the beginning of Jonson’s sole-authored volume, therefore, a collaborator in the literary construction identifies and promotes his own influential hand.</para>

This is the ending preferred by earlier editors of Jonson as giving a stronger ending to the Folio. An individual voice imposes law on mortals, arguably even articulating Jonson’s own voice in bringing the masque to an ordered close. However, other copies following printing house corrections instead close with a Choir singing collectively:

</poetry>
</blockquote>
This ending, preferred by the Cambridge edition, reverses the direction in which the final words are spoken, replacing the sole authorial voice with collaborative acclamation. Where Astraea descends from Heaven to Earth, here the voices return ‘from earth to heaven’.</para>

Yes, it showed the realistic winter landscape; however, it was not Wang Wei’s winter landscape any more, which was filled with spiritual abundance beyond the principles of writing.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003291" role="end-ch-note" label="6">

Lü’s modified work, in Tang’s opinion, changed the spirit as well as the rich imagination of his original text, just as Wang Wei’s famous painting should not be viewed as a realistic scene but instead as a lyrical expression of colours, a contrast of opposites and a display of unrestrained talents.</para>

        </footnote> Pollard’s observation is also applicable to the reverse situation – playwrights’ responses to their audiences. Plays themselves offer important insights into audience management from the stage-end, as well as playwright interpretations of audience conduct and function, though they are self-evidently biased. Andrew Gurr suggests that ‘the complex interactive communication between stage and audience […] depends as much on the audience’s state of mind as it does on the author’s and players’ expectations of what, mentally, their audience will be prepared for’.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003648" role="end-ch-note" label="2">

        </indexterm>There were two ways in which an audience could legitimately influence a play: at the writing stage and at the performance stage. The first is perhaps the most obvious. That playwrights had to consider, create and presumably direct players with an audience in mind can be taken for granted. In 1620, the printer introducing C. J.’s <emphasis role="italic">The Two Merry Milkmaids</emphasis> stated that every writer ‘must govern his pen according to the capacity of the stage he writes to, both in the actor and the auditor’.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003658" role="end-ch-note" label="3">

Jonson asks that audiences remain in their allotted positions – spectators and hearers alike. Gurr points out that Jonson associates the hearers with favour and judiciousness, while the spectators are envious. The groundlings here are judgemental and prone to formulate their own ‘understanding’ of the play, rather than consider the playwright’s motive, for instance.

Here Beaumont draws attention to the centrality of any given audience in any given playhouse. The players and their play are overshadowed by the new plot imposed on them by the audience. In spite of the play at hand, all our hypothetical audience members seem to desire is a story about a grocer who kills a lion with a pestle. Though satirical, the play reveals authorial concerns about audience interaction, interpretation and, ultimately, adaptation of plays. Beaumont’s satire, as well as ridiculing the agency hall plays apparently gave to their audiences, expresses anxiety about pleasing those same customers at face-level, during the performance itself.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003827">By this logic, audiences should not treat playhearing/observing/going as a comparative activity; rather, each play must be judged according to its own merits and weakness. This is why so many frameworking narratives in the forms of prologues and epilogues exist: they approach, warn and apologize to the audience for what they are about to or have just seen. They operate like a pre-theatre agreement or disclosure intellectually and artistically to withhold responsibility for any dissatisfaction. This is not surprising, especially in the light of Jason Scott-Warren’s essay in this volume (<link role="xref" linkend="b-9781472587206-chapter10">Section 5.2</link>) on early modern play publication and Shakespeare’s, in particular, apparent indifference to it.

The less documented kind of revision comes from the nature of playing companies as repertory players. Gurr notes that with growing playing companies, playwrights were increasingly prolific, meaning that audiences came to expect new offerings on a weekly, sometimes daily basis. In turn, new plays were mingled with older plays to create a repertory unique to each company.

But, as Gary Taylor notes, the cost of hiring the playwright to produce additional scenes or make alterations, or even a stand-in playwright to adapt an older work, coupled with the expense of replacing worn-out costumes and props, would suggest that only the popular plays were worth reviving.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003860" role="end-ch-note" label="21">

Though this was most likely the case, it is amusing that in spite of Theseus’s call to skip the epilogue to the play-within-the-play, Shakespeare proceeded to bolt one onto the end of his, along with something approaching an apology: ‘Gentles, do not reprehend. / If you pardon, we will mend’ (5.1. 423–4).<indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0003870" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0003746"/>

Instead, they were very likely passed down from one generation of performers to the next, during the course of which various changes were introduced. By carefully comparing the scenes in these collections with their counterparts in the earlier and complete versions of the plays in question, we are able to acquire some useful information on the theatrical performances of the early seventeenth century.</para>

Bojie endeavours to decline the marriage, but fails.

Zhao Wuniang – Bojie’s first wife – endures all manner of hardship while looking after her <?page value="213"?>invalid parents-in-law, who long for their only son. After the old couple die during a famine, she leaves home penniless and sets out for the capital.

The results of that transformation extended from the provision of a wider instrumental palette to the very shaping of the drama itself, as the five-act structure was underlined by the musical interludes that filled the act breaks. The musical revolution also prompted the ‘retro-fitting’ of existing plays with additional opportunities for music, song and dance. This new musical richness, I will argue, also modified the nature of the relationship between the drama and the <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004178" class="singular">

        </footnote> It seems odd, indeed, that modern writers who themselves happily endure the assault of electronic amplification in confined spaces should be so confident that Tudor and Stuart audiences could not have enjoyed the visceral thrill of loud noise even in an indoor theatre. Furthermore, very recent experiments in the new indoor Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at Shakespeare’s Globe demonstrate unequivocally that trumpet and drum are perfectly tolerable in a space which is actually smaller than the Blackfriars.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004199">It is surely partly the case, then, that it is the nature of the action in ‘trumpet-and-drums’ plays characteristically including scenes of battle, with the demands they make upon the much more limited stage space of the indoor theatres, which produced a shift in the need for these instruments, rather than the loudness of the sound in itself. Even more likely, and of rather more consequence, is the simple fact that cornets are versatile, but difficult instruments to play. They could provide the flourishes that trumpets might provide, but could equally play melodies and accompany voices.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004200" role="end-ch-note" label="3">

        </footnote> The stage direction ‘cornetts’, then, implies most strongly ‘here are expert musicians’, not ‘here is a quieter substitute for trumpets’. In recent years, as interest in the playing of old instruments has grown and become much more expert, cornettists have generally tended to be instrumentalists trained initially as trumpeters; in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, by contrast, cornettists doubled on wind instruments such as the oboe/shawm or flute. Might it not be, therefore, that once the King’s Men acquired a professional band of musicians they simply no longer needed to employ trumpeters – who were in any case considered a breed apart?

        </footnote> No doubt it is in part the ambivalence of Middleton’s satirical representation of the witches, and, by implication, his critique of those credulous enough to believe in their charms, which has contributed to the almost universally negative perception of the Hecate scenes when transferred to Shakespeare’s play. They are almost always cut in modern performance. Shakespeare in his original text appears to be representing King James’s firm belief in witchcraft, embodied in his <emphasis role="italic">Demonologie</emphasis> (1597), rather than siding with the scepticism of Reginald Scot’s <emphasis role="italic">Discoverie of Witchcraft</emphasis> of 1584 to which the king had been responding. Within the culture of the time there was deep ambivalence about the very existence and practice of witchcraft. A modern audience, however, with little or no investment in the reality of witchcraft, yet a desire to find the weird sisters truly threatening, is in danger of simplifying the complex and contradictory attitudes that might have been found in a <indexterm class="startofrange" xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004347">

The juxtaposition of menace and comic undercutting characterizes <emphasis role="italic">The Witch</emphasis>, and is generated in Shakespeare’s play by the insertion of the Hecate scenes. Far from finding them trivial, however, all the evidence points to the continued presence in <emphasis role="italic">Macbeth</emphasis> of Middleton’s Hecate and her company, and to the long-lasting importance of the musical interludes in the witches’ performance to the play’s audiences. As Stephen Orgel observes: ‘to judge from the play’s stage history, the vaudevillian witches constituted a stroke of theatrical genius’.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004350" role="end-ch-note" label="18">

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004391">Johnson’s setting of ‘Come away’ belongs very clearly to the latter category. It is in a style sometimes known as ‘declamatory’, a kind of semi-recitative which eschews simple melody until the final section. It might have been ornamented in performance; its frequent octave leaps demand at the least a reasonably accomplished singer. Moreover, this style was associated with the court masque, and had been introduced by Alfonso Ferrabosco and Nicholas Lanier just a few years before. In 1617 Jonson’s <emphasis role="italic">Lovers Made Men</emphasis>, set by Lanier, <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004392" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0004337"/>

This suggests that the music as event, as performance, is becoming more significant than music as a direct expression of a ‘realistic’ character. Something the same is true of Johnson’s expressive chromatic setting of the madman’s song, ‘Howl, howl’ for <emphasis role="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</emphasis> a couple of years earlier. This is also a highly sophisticated piece of music which demands expert performance in a way that, say, Ophelia’s mad songs do not. Its representation of madness, like the musical expression of demonic possession in the <emphasis role="italic">Macbeth</emphasis> song, looks forward to the scenes in post-Restoration mad songs, converting distraction or menace into an aesthetic object to be appreciated by the musically sophisticated.</para>

        </footnote> But the effect and affect of music is much more complicated than this. Film criticism has accustomed us to the distinction between ‘diegetic’ and ‘non-diegetic’ music – between music that is part of the action, and music that exists in the ears of the audience, but not in the consciousness of the characters on stage. I believe that there is little evidence for the existence of the latter category of music in early modern drama. What certainly exists, however, is a different kind of sound, which we might call music as part of the experience of being in a theatre, created primarily by the pre-show concert and by the entr’acte music. Not only is this music detached from the action, but its executants, too, are separable from the acting troupe.

It is, of course, true that the borderline between ‘popular’ and ‘art’ music was nowhere near as firmly drawn in the early modern period as (regrettably) it has become more recently.

Xu Wei concedes that their criticism is not entirely off the mark when he writes: ‘Southern [songs] are easy to compose, yet there are few excellent ones; northern [songs] are hard to write, yet there are some exquisite ones.

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004529">The partiality of men of letters for northern theatre and their assiduous endeavours to transform this genre into a legitimate and respectable literary form had, for Xu, led to neglect of the southern tradition.

To avoid the charge of vulgarity, Xu required that the music of theatre possess some modal organization, and underlined that southern music had a ‘kind of harmony’, but this was not the same as fitting it into modes. A mode is a musical term that indicates the pitch on which a basic scale is constructed. Modes were considered important in determining the emotional context of a piece of music, and may originally have been instrumental for musicians in clarifying pitch (in wind and string instruments) and perhaps also for singers.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004602" role="end-ch-note" label="20">

In a later anecdote, Xu described a scene in which the first Ming emperor, Hongwu (1328–98), after seeing a performance of <emphasis role="italic">The Lute</emphasis> for the first time, compared it to the classics and praised its singularity: ‘Gao Ming’s <emphasis role="italic">The Lute</emphasis> is like the most exquisite delicacies from the mountains or the sea, that the noble and rich households cannot do without.’ <footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004614" role="end-ch-note" label="22">

An emphasis on the tonal composition of words, and the use of strings in marking the rhythm, are two aspects of this phenomenon. Once the music of <emphasis role="italic">Kun</emphasis> drama was established, it became the predominant musical style of southern drama.</para>
          </footnote> That the Ming emperor was incapable of appreciating the music without setting it to strings is best understood as a form of indirect criticism, not just of the emperor’s oafish lack of understanding of musical propriety but also of the stubborn preference of the elite for northern music. Xu himself was not entirely against the practice of adding strings to southern drama, but he accepted these modifications in an attempt to search for a balance between the authentic nature of southern music and his own refined aesthetic experience.</para>

          </indexterm>Undoubtedly, for the late sixteenth-century champion of <emphasis role="italic">bense</emphasis>, Xu Wei, there was a discrepancy between text and performance. In order to establish drama as a reputable genre of literati endeavour, he was limited by the conventionally accepted cultural domains of <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004643" class="singular">
            <primary>poetry</primary>

But whether these requirements underscored the practice of theatre or simply referred to the language on the page, we cannot know. The final aim of establishing <emphasis role="italic">bense</emphasis> as a critical standard, however, went beyond the demands of drama whether creative, receptive or critical; it was a means of establishing a value for a neglected but bourgeoning genre in order to position it in the larger framework of Chinese literary practice. In a similar manner, Xu insisted on the unstructured nature of the music of southern drama, singling out for praise what many aficionados had identified as flaws. Whether this musical freedom was ultimately desirable was questioned even by Xu, but it was certainly proof of the genesis of the form and of its <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004645" class="singular">

          </indexterm>By 1616, a little over two decades after Xu’s death, the terms of the debate that were to establish southern drama as a legitimate vehicle of elite expression were firmly in place. Theatre was evaluated for what it had been, as critics speculated on the origins of southern theatre, and for what it was. They continued to defend the nature of drama through references to an earlier, nobler pedigree, claiming that at its origins southern theatre was unaffected and natural, and related to these issues the aspects of theatre they valued most, music and language; but by this time, the terms of this debate had been expanded to include not just the language and the music, but also narrative, <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004648" class="singular">

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004709">First, some context. When the King’s Men established themselves at the Blackfriars in 1609, they demonstrated that an adult commercial theatre company, running a daily repertory, could make a profit in a smaller, more expensive indoor venue. This had not previously been apparent: the indoor theatres at Blackfriars and Paul’s (which operated until 1606) had until this time been used for performances by boys, drawn either from the royal chapel choirs or run as commercial entertainment companies. The boys had not performed daily, and their repertories were not as wide as those of the adult companies, professionals who occupied the large amphitheatres in the suburbs. The King’s Men proved that the habits of an adult company were suited to the different playing conditions and audience composition of an indoor venue, where the cheapest seat in the upper gallery cost sixpence – the price of a seat in a box at the Globe. Christopher Beeston, then the manager of Queen Anne’s Men at the <indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004710" class="singular">

        </indexterm>Red Bull in Clerkenwell, took note. In 1616 he invested some £400 of company money in the leasing and conversion of the ‘edifices or building called the cockpits and the cock houses and the sheds thereunto adjoining’ in the newly developing neighbourhood of Covent Garden. Beeston’s company had just started playing in the new indoor theatre in March 1617, when an apprentice riot caused serious damage, but by July 1617 the playhouse was up and running.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004711" role="end-ch-note" label="5">

        </footnote> The Salisbury Court was almost certainly a close copy of the Cockpit. It was these two structures that survived into the Restoration (the Blackfriars had by this point been converted into tenements). The Salisbury Court suffered at the hands of Interregnum soldiers who, as the records of a lawsuit reveal, ‘by force of arms entered the said playhouse, cut down the seats, broke down the stage, and utterly defaced the whole building’. This damage was repaired in 1659 to return ‘the said theatre and all the seats and boxes and viewing rooms thereto belonging’ to their original state.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004740" role="end-ch-note" label="9">

Beeston repeated this manoeuvre in 1622 when Prince Charles’ Men were dispatched to a suburban amphitheatre and the Lady Elizabeth’s Men placed at the Cockpit. In 1625 it happened again: he formed a new company for the Cockpit, partly out of the existing troupes, called Queen Henrietta’s Men in honour of the new French queen, which was to thrive for the next decade, the period of the Cockpit’s greatest success.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004770" role="end-ch-note" label="13">

Inevitably, this drew artistic investment and talent from the big outdoor venues, where up to 3,000 spectators (half of them standing in the unroofed yard) could watch a play for as little as a penny.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004888">1616 was not the year in which England’s theatre changed for good. The development of playhouse design, repertory and audience was evolutionary, not revolutionary. Historical and literary scholarship is rarely well served by the insistence on false nativities or teleologies. The other essays in this volume have illuminated ways in which theatre culture can be sustained in a variety of forms and modes, including print, performance, elite and popular. But I have suggested that a corner was turned when Beeston developed the indoor Cockpit in Drury Lane, and if the slow decline of the suburban amphitheatre is to be assigned an origin, then 1616 is as good as any.<indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004889" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0004843"/>

This, to my knowledge, is the only case of marginal commentary that comprises nothing but direct quotations from a play. Such a highly unusual use of the marginal space of the page pushes to the fore the act of reading as the deciding source that produces meaning. By citing exclusively from <emphasis role="italic">The Western Wing</emphasis> as an established cultural icon, the marginal commentary functions very much as a mediating figure that engages the novella in its discursive reading of the play, so much so that the hierarchy of the book page in its spatial layout may be fully reversed, as the text proper presents itself to be a commentary on the play. This is an ingeniously conceived literary game that probably targeted a very exclusive group of readers such as drama connoisseurs in the Jiangnan area.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004964" role="end-ch-note" label="7">

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004979">The fictional construction of King Hailing as the ultimate barbaric <emphasis role="italic">other</emphasis> is enabled by the marginal commentary which shows how the Jurchen king upsets the Confucian ethical codes in fundamental ways. One of the earlier episodes employs the trope of voyeurism common in erotic fiction by having King Hailing stage an orgy in front of a peeping virgin, Chongjie, the fifteen-year-old daughter of Hailing’s consort Alihu, in order to seduce the young maiden: he has the ground covered with fabric and orders that everyone strips naked. He then chases after his consorts to force them into copulation. Chongjie is indeed aroused, and allows herself to be deflowered. Enchanted by his new possession, Hailing casts Alihu aside for days. When the forlorn mother confronts her daughter for having stolen the monarch away from her, the marginal commentary reads: ‘She’ll turn you into a loving, a caring, a handsome husband, / So why fear a mother who now has the power to restrict her?’<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0004980" role="end-ch-note" label="8">

What Li Rihua has added in his revision is Crimson’s repressed sexual frustration, a development that <emphasis role="italic">The Retrieved History of Hailing</emphasis> further pursues in the episode featuring Hailing’s seduction of Dingge (Oriole’s counterpart in the novella) through the help of the latter’s maid Guige (Crimson’s <?page value="272"?>counterpart). The novella goes to great lengths to impress the reader with the maid’s quick wit and persuasive power that allows her to successfully bring Hailing into the inner quarters of her mistress. At this point, Crimson’s repressed sexual frustration in the <emphasis role="italic">Southern Western Wing</emphasis> (‘My rootless amorous feelings – to whom can I plead to give vent to them?’) is amplified in the novella into Guige’s surging desire: ‘They left Guige all by herself to listen to them for a while, then get up to peek for a while. Hearing and witnessing all this merry-making rendered her even more desolate, as she tossed and turned, not being able to keep her eyes shut.’<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005090" role="end-ch-note" label="25">

        </para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005092">Li Rihua falls short of having Crimson fulfil her unrequited desire, and no redaction of the northern play has ever allowed Crimson to have sexual intercourse with Student Zhang – such a design would certainly compromise the highly aestheticized romantic story. By contrast, in the novella Guige indeed receives her physical reward from Hailing after the latter consummated his affair with her mistress. At this point the marginal commentary appropriates Crimson’s worry that the Old Lady may find out about the tryst in <emphasis role="italic">Southern Western Wing</emphasis> to refer instead to Guige’s fear lest her own lady finds out about her transgression (‘Yet I am afraid that the Lady will wake up’). The novella then proceeds to turn Guige into a most disturbing version of Crimson who eventually supersedes her own mistress to become Hailing’s consort, producing an altogether new theatre of lust and betrayal.</para>

          <emphasis role="italic">The Retrieved History of Hailing</emphasis> therefore makes a compelling case for us to understand how the prolificacy of imprints helped to cultivate reading as a creative energy, as the novella is as much about the act of writing as it is about the act of reading.

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005117">The task of exploring the ‘Brave new theatres’ of China and England in 1616 presents a number of intractable methodological questions. We are not dealing here with the established analytical methods applied to contemporary intercultural performance or cultural exchange but with the much more difficult task of identifying synergies between different forms of theatre from quite distinct and geographically distant cultural and literary formations. Those distinctions of geography and culture impose severe limits on the direct connections that characterize a ‘diffusion model’ of cultural exchange, though identifying those limits also helps us to define the terms in which the enquiry can usefully take place.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005118">It is clear, for example, that by 1616, England and China were part of the same imaginative world. As David Markley observes:
<blockquote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005119">
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005120">No literate man or woman in western Europe could plead ignorance of the relative size, wealth and natural resources of, say, England and China. By the middle of the seventeenth century, China had become a crucial site of contention and speculation in a variety of fields … and, most significantly, the wealth of the nation whetted a seemingly insatiable desire (among Europeans) for Chinese goods and what seemed, for many merchants, an infinitely profitable trade.</para>
</blockquote>
Markley’s analysis deals with the economic basis for this imaginative link that allows him to map the ‘complex network <?page value="278"?>of ports, agricultural regions and trading opportunities’ known to international traders onto the travel narratives that envisioned ‘an almost ritualistic praise of the country’s natural wealth and the industry of its people’.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005121" role="end-ch-note" label="1">

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005127">The heroic dimensions of this early modern vision of China’s potential for economic exploitation depended, however, on the mediating interests and knowledge of those who imagined them. Unlike the travellers and merchants who saw China as a source of wealth and adventure, most early modern writers had no direct experience of the world beyond England. Instead, the world outside England was always seen in relation to the one they knew. ‘China’ existed as a defining by-word for the exotic and the strange. Recording Shane O’Neil’s 1562 visit to England, the antiquarian William Camden described his ‘Guard of Ax-bearing Galloglasses, bare-headed, with curled Hair hanging down, … whom the English people gazed at with no less admiration than now-adays they do them of China and America’.<footnote xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005128" role="end-ch-note" label="2">

The comparison only provided a means of establishing Englishness as the central norm from which to judge the literal ‘outlandishness’ of other cultures.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005140">A similar Anglo-centric parochialism was evident in the discourse of the early modern stage. On the rare occasions when China – as opposed to a more generic ‘east’ – is mentioned in plays of the time, the exotic and essentially strange character of Chinese practices has become assimilated into a commonplace location for a joke.

        </footnote> Dulcimella’s prattle, of course, tells us nothing with any authority about the perceptions of or connection to China in early modern England. She is as unreliable a witness as <?page value="279"?>most characters in plays. The connection between characters’ perceptions of any feature of early modern culture is mediated by literary and theatrical demands made by dramatic narratives that condition their existence. The characters exist in an imagined world that includes commonplace, casual references to exotic objects but those references are fully assimilated into the idiosyncratic speech of a particular character in a particular situation.</para>

He launches into a rambling, complicated story: ‘Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your honour’s reverence, for stewed prunes; sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very distant time stood as it were, in a fruit-dish, a dish of some three-pence, your honours have seen such dishes; they are not china dishes, but very good dishes’ (<emphasis role="italic">Measure for Measure</emphasis>, 2.1.88–94). ‘China’, in Pompey’s speech, is a synecdoche for the high status trade goods that constituted the main material connection to the exotic imagined land of travellers and merchants.

Foreign travel and trade are constructed as part of the lived experience that shapes their relation to the <?page value="280"?>world in which they find themselves and the articulation of difference is central to the emotional structure of the plays in which they appear.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005159">As theorists of cultural exchange have shown, the process of cultural exchange needs to pay close attention to the discursive locations of the centre, periphery and direction of travel, not merely in material terms but in terms of the needs and impulses of those who engage with it. As the bathos of passing references to China shows, the fact that early modern England and early modern China were part of the same trading world is far from creating the conditions for being part of the same cultural world.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005160">Since the intervening effects of character and situation complicate the cultural exchange effected by contact and diffusion, it may be more appropriate to identify cultural synergies by working through models of ‘parallel development’: the analogies between practices that seem to evolve in similar ways even when there is limited identifiable contact involved between the cultures concerned. Here, too, we must be alert to the tension between parallels and false analogies, wittily dramatized in Fluellen’s comic attempt to insist on the greatness of his king, Henry V, born at Monmouth, by a comparison with Alexander the Great, born in Macedon:

This emphasis on the literary qualities of the Jacobean repertory may have helped to establish the dominance of the King’s Men, the company that had produced Shakespeare’s plays. In 1616, their performances dominated entertainments at court. From November 1615 to April 16 they presented ‘fourteen unnamed plays’ before the king and queen; and between 31 October 1616 and 5 March 1617 they offered thirteen plays (unnamed) before the king and queen.<indexterm xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005242" class="endofrange" startref="b-9781472587206-0005205"/>

<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005307">Brewer’s play is chronologically confused: he draws on two different phases of the Danish invasions of Britain and includes a subplot that deals with Thornton, a historical Mayor of Newcastle from the fifteenth century. It is also generically unstable, not only in combining the conflict of Dane and Anglo Saxon with the comic scenes in Newcastle but in bringing together the battle narratives with a double melodrama of disastrous love stories. The play never achieves the stable arc that links the narrative to an emotional movement in a Shakespeare play. Yet in literary terms, <?page value="287"?>and at the level of individual scenes, its management of narrative and the rhetoric of high emotion, it is remarkably accomplished.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9781472587206-0005308">The play is clearly a product of a literary culture, not only in its use of literary sources such as John Speed’s <emphasis role="italic">History of the Empire of Great Britaine</emphasis> and its adaptation of the plot of William Barksted’s <emphasis role="italic">Hiren, or, The Faire Greeke</emphasis> (1611) but in its attention to irony and suspense. Its rhetoric turns on the familiar trope of the contrast between love and war as the victorious Danish King Canutus is unmanned by his (ultimately successful) passion for the chaste nun Cartesmunda and his loyal soldiers’ despair of the loss of all the victories he has gained. The war scenes move from foreground to background as the seduction narrative develops, and then come to the foreground again as the English forces are rallied with support from the Scots. The resolution of the narrative takes precedence over that of the love stories. Both Cartesmunda and the parallel love plot of the Danish Elgina and her English lover, Alured, are killed accidentally, caught by their opponents’ sword play, and the newly triumphant English king graciously offers a model of kingly victory by extending mercy to Canutus, rescinding the Danish tribute and extending Scottish lands from the Tyne to the Tweed.</para>

These literary skills arguably facilitated the development of a wide-ranging and robust theatre industry that may provide a more secure basis for examining parallel developments in other parts of the world.

Theatre is nothing without an audience, which both reflects and helps to shape taste, so we need to know as much as we can about those who saw plays in both countries.
